# BlockPop

A simple Breakout clone made with the [Godot Engine](http://www.godotengine.org).

**Note**: This project was made with Godot 1.1, when I was first learning Godot. It's probably not a good idea to use this as a reference. This project won't work with newer Godot releases.

## Running

If you have the [Godot Engine](http://www.godotengine.org), just download the repo and run the project inside the `game` folder with it.

Otherwise you can download one of the [releases in this repo](https://github.com/vnen/blockpop/releases) and just run the binary.
